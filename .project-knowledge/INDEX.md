# Job Hunter Agent — Knowledge Index

> Last updated: 2026-08-16
> Status: Active
> Stack: Python + FastAPI + Firecrawl + Exa (fallback) + Claude Code CLI (subprocess) + vanilla JS/Tailwind + Typst (CV rendering)
> Current goal: Nothing blocking — the full pipeline plus the apply stage has run end to end on real scraped postings. Open work is scrape quality (thin listing-page descriptions, LinkedIn yielding nothing, unnormalized `posted_date`). See roadmap.md

## What This Project Does
An autonomous, profession-agnostic job-hunting pipeline. It reads a user-supplied `resume.md`, derives search queries with Claude, discovers and scrapes remote job postings via Firecrawl, scores each against the resume, and drafts cover letters plus tailored Typst/PDF CVs for the best matches. A per-job apply stage then has a second Claude call review the letter for invented claims and requirement coverage before you send it — all reviewable in a local single-file web dashboard.
